# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype


## Project Description
### Purpose:
>This project aims to solve any user challenges that may arise when signing up for a wine subscription service.
I want to find whether or not the features I have designed help the process run more smoothly and promote user satisfaction. The features I have designed 
to improve a wine subscription service are as follow:


### User Personas:
> The target audience for my product are middle-aged women who are looking for products and services that make them happy. 
However, I am also targeting users who love wine and would benefit from an online service. Targeted users understand how to use technology and the internet, but want an accessibility friendly website. Based on my user research, users enjoy websites that are simple understand, answer their questions before they are asked, and are not too challenging to navigate. Users want a solid solution for their problem and do not wish to work harder on an internet solution than they would by purchasing their wine in store.

### Features and Tasks:
> 
##### 1. Personalization Quiz Tab 
> Users will immediately spot the "Personalization Quiz" tab on the upper right hand side of the website. By spotting this tab, users will
take their wine quiz and unlock their preferences and a discount. The tab will stand out from the other menu options since it is essentially one of the
most important. The task is to find a way to personalize wine to the user's liking, especially if they rely on recommendations for purchases.



##### 2. Event Delivery Filter
> For users who are looking for a service that caters for their events and gatherings, the event delivery filter will be present. When filtering through wine subscription packages (e.g. 6 per month/ 12 per month/ etc.), users will 
find a filter that allows them to set up a scheduled wine delivery. The filter will appear when users select their service, but will be promoted under the services tab. 
The task is to find wine delivery for an event, preferably a scheduled one where the user can select different wines.

##### 3. Recommendation Meter 
> Reviews and recommendations can make or break a product, the user needs to have easy access to them. Next to every bottle of wine, there will be a recommendation meter that provides the average reviews on a ratio scale of 1-10. By limiting the reviews to a ratio scale instead of stars or percentages, the reviews will be more straightforward for the user. The task is to find a bottle or two that have a meter score of 8 and above.

#### Flow Description:
> The user will first arrive to the homepage of the wine subscription service. Next to the name of the website, there are 5 menu options and an icon representing a shopping cart. The menu reads: Wines, cases, winemakers, services, and quiz. The user will then create their profile and click the "get started" button to take their personalization quiz. The button will take them to a new page where they will take their quiz. After finishing their quiz, a new page with wine recommendations will appear. The "Recommendation Meter" will reveal the average reviews of the given wines so that the user can decide which they want to add to their cart. Once the wines are added to the cart, the users will be presented with a window showing their current cart and other recommendations. After reviewing the cart, the user will click on "Continue to subscription plans" and will be navigated to a new window. This new window will display the different services the user can sign up for. If the user wants to order wine delivery for an event, this is where they will select the option. By selecting "Event Delivery," the user will fill out their information and delivery details before confirming the order. This flow incorporates 3 features: Quiz, Recommendation Meter, and Event Delivery Filter.
