## Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
### Description of Project

>  For this project, I am building a website where consumers can purchase fine wines from the comfort of their own homes. 
My website is designed to make the online shopping experience as seemless and enjoyable as possible, even if a consumer is not very technologically experienced. I have also incorporated a few features tailored to a specific kind of consumer, a personalization quiz and event delivery service.
The graphic design of my page features a color palette inspired by the different array of wines that inspired this project. From a Merlot magenta to a soft orange resembling moscato, the colors tell a story of their own. I have also selected icons and images
that are clear and not difficult to understand. The icons are modeled "lineraly" and are all cohesive with each other throughout the pages. I have currently digitalized my wireframes to match the personal scenearios from the previous weeks.


### Color

The graphical interface design process went smoothly because the published version of the OutWrite Magazine website already has an established and consistent outlook, and thus when I was creating the prototype, I primarily followed the constructed color theme, layout, and graphical elements, but with a few changes. First of all, the OutWrite website has an abundant amount of visual assets – illustrations, thumbnail pictures, and photos. Thus, for a relatively simple and clean outlook, I choose to stick with three colors: 1. The color of “OUT” from the logo #E8228C; 2. Black #000000; and 3. The gray color, #F5F5F5. However, I encountered a problem when I was checking with color contrast: the color of “OUT” and the gray color both fail to qualify for at least 4.5:1 ratio with the white background (#FFFFFF). Thus, I changed the saturation of both colors to get a slightly darker version of these two colors for a higher color contrast.
