## Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
### Description of Project

>  For this protype, I am building a website where consumers can purchase fine wines from the comfort of their own homes. 
My website is designed to make the online shopping experience as seemless and enjoyable as possible, even if a consumer is not very technologically experienced. I have also incorporated a few features tailored to a specific kind of consumer, a personalization quiz and event delivery service.
The graphic design of my page features a color palette inspired by the different array of wines that inspired this project. From a Merlot magenta to a soft orange resembling moscato, the colors tell a story of their own. I have also selected icons and images
that are clear and not difficult to understand. The icons are modeled "lineraly" and are all cohesive with each other throughout the pages. I have currently digitalized my wireframes to match the personal scenearios from the previous weeks.

### Impression Test

#### Summary of Impression Test: 
> For the Impression Test of my prototype, I walked my user through my wireframes and asked about the design of the pages. Tara immediately expressed interest in the color scheme of the site and the design of the logo. When asked if the background of the site was distracting, she stated that it was blurred enough to not be a distraction when viewing the website. Tara also noticed the correlation between the wines and the colors of the website. After showing her the homepage, I navigated her through the quiz function to get feedback on the layout. She expressed liking the clarity of the text and the contrasting colors. I then showed her the results and check out pages. Tara enjoyed the transition buttons and how easy the cart icon was to find. Again, she continued to express interest in the colors and the icons on the different pages. She also enjoyed the large icons of the wines and the circular aesthetic. 



### Color & Accessibility Check

> When creating my protoype, I wanted to select a color palette that resembled the idea behind my design. When purchasing items, it is nice to have a color scheme that reminds you of what you are purhcasing. To find colors similar to that of an array of different wines, I used Adobe Color. With Adobe color, I found the perfect shades of orange and magenta that would fit the aesthetic design of my website. Before applying my colors, I made sure to test the color contrast for accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level. I used 5 colors for my design: Black (#1C1515), Light Orange (#F0A254), White (#FFFFFF), Light Magenta (#C9597B), and Light Pink (#FAF3F3). My colors all pass the ratio guidelines and the meet the accessibility AA level.

### Interactive Prototypes Supported

#### 1. Browsing wines and viewing their "Cloud Meter" Rating
#### 2. Accessing and getting results for the wine personalization quiz
#### 3. A HOME button in the middle of the menu bar that allows users to return to the home page easily
#### 4. A menu where each button leads users to what they are searching for, whether that be wines, cases, etc.
#### 5. Subscription Service tab allows users to explore their montly options



> In my current prototype and design, I featured three tasks that I described in my Persona assignment. The first is the personalization quiz available when the user clicks "Get Started" in either the menu or home page. After the user completes the quiz and continues, the top recommendations are presented along with the option to add them to cart. The cart page then recommends even more wines before check out. The check out allows the user to select the subscription service and the page leads to a confirmation. The second task is booking event delivery. Here the user can click on "services" or at checkout be led to services. The services then lead to a booking page where the user must select a date, time, and enter their personal information. After this page, the user can check out and get a confirmation notice. I also added a third feature that allows users to perform the task of reviewing wine ratings at a glance on a ratio scale of 1-10. The feature is called the "Cloud Meter" and is under every wine and case.
