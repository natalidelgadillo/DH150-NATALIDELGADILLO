### Wine Tasting Subscription Services
> For this assignment, I want to analyze the different kinds of wine tasting subscription services offered online. My college friends and I have recently picked up a passion for red wine, peaking my interest in easy and affordable subscription services. In addition, many middle aged women in my life find happiness in the perfect glass of wine. From colorful reds to dry whites, the ideal glass of wine is not easy to find. Not only is every bottle of wine different in their type, but every individual prefers different blends. From my research I found two top online sellers, Winc and Naked Wines. By improving UX design, the sites would allow for an easier, more personal experience to those seeking to find their favorite wine. 

### Severity Scale for Usability Problems  
Rating | Assessment
------------ | -------------
1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

### Heuristic Evaluation of Website - WINC Wine Subscription Service 

https://www.winc.com/wines

> Winc is an online wine subscription service that allows you to try different kinds of wines every month. Winc connects you to a world of exclusive wines tailored to your preferences. When first joining, the website prompts you with a few starter steps. First, you answer 6 questions based on your existing wine preferences. After answering the questions, Winc recommends a few bottles that you may enjoy. After your first delivery, you rate the bottles to better customize your future deliveries. Winc has a minimal design and allows you to browse their wide variety of wine selections. The navigation features 5 selections: Profile, wines, gifts, discover, and invest.

### Initial Evaluation
> Winc has an easy to navigate, minimalist website from first impression. It is easy to find the main categories that would be most important to have on a wine subscription website. The very first page shows all of the different wines that they have and categorizes them by winemaking and even sweetness. It is slightly overwhelming how many options there are and how they are all layed out at once. As you scroll down, there are top rated wines and more categories to explore, somewhat repetitive.


### #1 Visibility of System Status   
Rating | Assessment
------------ | -------------
1 | When a user hovers over the main 5 categories, "Invest" does not light up the same way that the others do.
2 | When adding an item to the shopping cart, the user does not get notified that the item has been added. The user must look at the shopping cart to see their item number increase.


### #2 Match between System and Real World   
Rating | Assessment
------------ | -------------
1 | Membership terminology is scattered out and not cohesive (e.g. regular price vs W members on products).
1 | Some terminology may be unclear to different age groups. The meaning of "hip" language is not immediately clear (e.g. Bev).
2 | Wine terminology may not be understood by new users. While most of the terms are common, certain ones could benefit from a small explanation when the user hovers over the word (e.g. body).

### #3 User Control and Freedom   
Rating | Assessment
------------ | -------------
1 | User loses place in list when clicking back and forth between wines.
2 | Cannot easily undo any items that have been accidentally removed from shopping cart. In addition, user cannot easily remove items accidentally added to shopping cart.


### #4 Consistency and Standards   
Rating | Assessment
------------ | -------------
1 | Some products do not have titles. You must click on the photo to learn the name of the wine.
2 | No arrows to scroll through wines, user must click on circles below widget to switch pages.
2 | Certain wine categories are redundant and appear multiple times per page.
3 | User is not provided with an easily accessible search bar. Difficult to locate desired item immediately by name or company since there is no search bar.
