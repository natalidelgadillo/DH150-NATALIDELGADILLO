# The Perfect Bottle of Wine: On Cloud Wine

## By Natali Delgadillo


### Introduction 
> *On Cloud Wine* is an online wine subscription service that facilitates the process of sampling and purchasing different kinds of wines on a monthly basis. It allows the user to purchase a variety of wines and have them easily delivered to their doorstep. The target users of the service are those who may be too busy to find their favorite wines or simply want a simpler alternative to going to the grocery store every time they need wine. After conducting user research, a personalization quiz, event service, and ratings meter would benefit the overall user experience of the wine shopper. 

### Design Statement

> My design's purpose is to bring joy to middle-aged women who enjoy wine but may not know what their favorite bottle is or may not have time to purchase wine. Wine tasting is a universally enjoyable experience, but may be out of reach for those who do not live near a vineyard or do not have the resources to experience it. On Cloud Wine allows users to try different wines every month based on their personalization quiz. My project also aims to make the wine selection process simple and enjoyable for the user, with many recommendations and different categroies clearly labeled. Users do not need to be the most technologically advanced to be able to navigate the website and understand the different types of wine subscription services that there are. I believe my subscription service combines the idea of online shopping with convenience and the excitement of trying new items every month.

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

> In order to improve features in the design of my project, I analyzed the user experience designs of other wine subscription service websites. From my research, I found two top online sellers, Winc and Naked Wines. By improving UX design, the sites would allow for an easier, more personal experience to those seeking to find their favorite wine. I found both websites offer a very differnet approach but integrate similar features. Through this heuristic evaluation, I explored the positives and negatives of my competitors' designs and user features.

### User Research: Contextual Inquiry
After conducting a heuristic evaluation, I identified my target users and conducted an interview. The observation methods I used were participatory observation and interview. I had my participant search for wine online and asked questions based off of their wine purchasing habits. Looking into her interests and preferences gave me a fresh intake of online shopping versus shopping in person. It was also important to note that the COVID-19 questions could have gone either way. Her answers helped understand how a busy student who has anxiety about the going to stores feels about shopping for their favorite goods in store.
