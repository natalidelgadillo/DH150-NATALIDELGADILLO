# DH150 Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry
## Introductory Steps
## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
> This project will aupport users in providing them with a personalized and unique wine tasting experience. By providing a month subscription of wine, users will discover their favorite winemakers and wine types. The service will allow for consumers to save time and effort by having their wine delivered to their front door.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
>This activity satisfies the user's need for wine that they can enjoy and want to continue to purchase. Many users are overwhelmed by the thousands of wines that exist, this service will tailor the monthly subscription to their favorite tastes. Users who currently purchase wine at the store may not be fully content with their choices but do not know how to branch out to other options. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> The current solution to satisfy this need are wineries, wine shops, and other wine subscription services. Wineries offer in person wine tasting and teach the user about the different wines. Due to COVID-19, many wineries have shut down and are not doing tastings. Wine shops sell wines but do not personalize them for the user. Other wine subscription services have the same idea as I do in mind, but have many flaws that I could improve with my project. 


### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
>The current limitations that could be improved with digital technology are the testing of a user's wine preferences and the accessibility a user has to their desired products. Technology would allow the user to get their prefered wine delivered to their front door with just subscribing online. An online quiz and questionaires would allow the suppliers to know what kind of wine the user prefers and would enjoy the most. Technology would facilitate many inconveniences that come with shopping in person, especially during the current pandemic. 



## Step 02: Target Users

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
> Demographic: Middle aged women searching for products and services that make them happy. Typically enjoy a glass of wine during dinner or after a long day. Also busy and cannot spend too much time looking for their favorite wines in stores.
> Preferences: Prefer to not spend too much time shopping in stores and selecting products. Want something that makes a decision for them so that they don't have to make one themselves. Enjoy online shopping and receiving things straight to their home. 
> Expertise: Users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application. 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
> Users would do the activity on their personal digital devices and try the wines at home. Users would need technology to create an account, complete their preference quiz, and sign up for a subscription service. They would after receive the wine in the mail and try it at home before reviewing it to better personalize their next batch. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

> Users would need to go out or online and purchase their wine. They would need to want to spend money on wine and make a selection of what kind they would prefer.


## Step 03: Pick research methods 
> The observation methods I used were participatory observation and interview. I had my participant search for wine online and asked questions based off of their wine purchasing habits. I also had her work from her desk at home to ensure she was comfortable and in her everyday setting.

## Interview Insights
### 1. The user is typically busy and finds it inconvenient to walk to the store. 
>  I would say I'm pretty busy with school, maybe a few hours a day per week. Sometimes it is inconvenient to go to the store because I have to walk to the store and it's a bit tiring. 

### 2. The user finds it convenient to do their shopping online.
> Yeah, it makes things a lot easier when you don't have to go places in person. It's a lot more convenient, it saves time and you don't have to leave your house.

### 3. The user liked the concept of subscribing to a wine service and would consider it.
> I think I always like using technology to look for things because it makes things easier. I didn't know wine subscription services existed. I definitely trust online less than in person. But I don't think there's anything wrong with purchasing wine online. And I am very open to doing so.

### 4. The user gets frustrated and unhappy when she runs out of wine and has to plan out a trip to the store.
>Um, I get a little frustrated that first because I really wanted some wine. Usually it takes you by surprise. And then I have to plan when I'm going to go get it because I have a pretty busy schedule. And then I have to pick which grocery store to go to because some have cheaper wines and some have nicer wines. And then I have to figure out when I'm going to go which I think I already said that. And then I'm just planning the trip and coming back and that always takes a decent amount of time. 

### 5. The user prefers to not visit stores as much due to COVID-19.
> Yes. 
COVID-19 makes me want to go to the stores less and less. I get really bad anxiety being around people for too long, I would prefer not to in this pandemic.


### 6. The user expressed interest in taking a wine preference survey and enjoyed the selections of wines online.
> No, I don't think I would find these at the store. It seems like a pretty wide selection. I haven't seen some of these before. What do you want assistance knowing which kind of wine is your favorite? 
Yes, that would be really fun and helpful since I don’t know a ton about the different kinds of wines.

## Step 06: Reflection
As I wrote up my interview questions, I did not know exactly what to expect from my participant. I had a few questions that may have revealed whether or not she was in my audience target, such as knowing whether she drank wine or not. I did enjoy looking at the activities and questions through her eyes, the different perspective helped me. Looking into her interests and preferences gave me a fresh intake of online shopping versus shopping in person. It was also important to note that the COVID-19 questions could have gone either way. Her answers helped understand how a busy student who has anxiety about the pandemic feels about shopping for their favorite goods in store. However, I did encounter a few problems while interviewing my participant. Some questions she was not sure how to answer or was afraid she was saying too much or too little. There was also a few lags with Otter transcription that made our dialogues mash together. My experience was mostly positive though, as she was a tech savy wine drinker who was looking for a faster and safer way to purchase her wine. I did notice her open up more to the idea of signing up for a subscription service once she visited a few websites and saw the wines offered. She enjoyed how there was a fair selection of wines online that were not available at the store. Her perspective has really helped assist in the kind of design I want to do, especially with the new challenges of shopping in a pandemic.
