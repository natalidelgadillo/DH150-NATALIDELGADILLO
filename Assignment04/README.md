# DH150 Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry
## Introductory Steps
## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users?
> This project will aupport users in providing them with a personalized and unique wine tasting experience. By providing a month subscription of wine, users will discover their favorite winemakers and wine types. The service will allow for consumers to save time and effort by having their wine delivered to their front door.

###What is the basic need involved for that activity?
>This activity satisfies the user's need for wine that they can enjoy and want to continue to purchase. Many users are overwhelmed by the thousands of wines that exist, this service will tailor the monthly subscription to their favorite tastes. Users who currently purchase wine at the store may not be fully content with their choices but do not know how to branch out to other options. 

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> The current solution to satisfy this need are wineries, wine shops, and other wine subscription services. Wineries offer in person wine tasting and teach the user about the different wines. Due to COVID-19, many wineries have shut down and are not doing tastings. Wine shops sell wines but do not personalize them for the user. Other wine subscription services have the same idea as I do in mind, but have many flaws that I could improve with my project.
